# vera (Chrome Extension)

A chrome extension used to detect uncertainty or a lack of confidence in writing and provide suggestions to combat it! Targeted towards gender minorities in the workplace.
When added, it automatically generates a button in editable text areas like Gmail, Outlook, LinkedIn, etc. 
Clicking the Check Text button will detect and highlight commonly used words and phrases that indicate uncertainty or a lack of confidence, and provide suggestions and motivation when the user hovers on these highlights with their mouse.
It will also generate a box that provides a more professional and confident paraphrase, as suggested by OpenAI. Buttons to accept or reject this change are also generated. If accepted, the paraphrase will automatically replace the original message. If rejected, the suggestion will be removed, leaving the original message as before.
